This is a project that we submitted to HackMIT 2020, a virtual hackathon hosted by MIT with over 1600 participants and 400 projects. This project took under 36 hours to create. *Please scroll down to check out our inspiration, solution, preview, and more!*

## Problem

Whether you are a high school student, college graduate, or an adult in their 40s, financial literacy is very important. But, there just isnâ€™t enough in our educational system that teaches people how to save for retirement and not have to worry about that social security check in their late 60s.

## Solution

So, we created **Buy or $hort!** Buy or $hort is an innovative Financial Literacy app that helps neologists of all age levels and experiences to learn how to predict Stocks using key metrics like Twitter posts, Stock statistics over time, and the most popular words related to the company! So in other words, it is an all in one data source that helps you analyze which components of the economy really affect those stock prices! Playing this game, and exploring through the data visualizations in Buy or $hort will teach you the secret to getting rich by playing mini-games(30 seconds each), which asks you whether you want to buy or short a stock. 

Who knows, maybe **YOU** can be a successful investor within minutes!
